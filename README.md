Derived with help from John: https://github.com/johnno1962/InjectionIII/issues/487

This is for the GitHub version of InjectionIII. I can't get the app store version to work. You have to run the app and choose "Open Project". Don't choose "Prepare Project"

I can't get it to run in standalone mode (maybe the trick is to reset or remove `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` in `MacOSWithInjectionIII.entitlements`).

The rest are in the commits in the repo.

Unlike most repos, I intend to force-push to this repo instead of adding commits because it's meant to show specific steps to set up a new project.
